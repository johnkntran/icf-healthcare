EHR application is miserable, worst I've ever seen

Ruth Sullivan here. Wanted to say EHR application gives me a headache. It crashes constantly. When I look up a patient, it then takes three clicks just to see their medication history. You desperately need to improve your UI/UX. The last time I used the auto-assessment feature, the app gave an inaccurate assessment of the patient based on her oral history. I also don't like the colors of the app - yellow is my least favorite color. I don't like the fact that the app logs me out every 10 minutes. Just so you know, I live on 829 Flagstone Ct in Springfield. Thanks!
