Very Happy with the EHR

Hi, my name is Frank McStevens. I am very happy with the product. I love using dot phrases that expand to polished sentences for quick note taking. I also like the user interface of the application. It is sleek and modern looking. The product is easy to navigate and intuitive. I never have any trouble clicking around. The app is also medically accurate. I can look up information about diseases with confidence. Lastly, my phone number is 827-927-9173. Thank you!
